              <h3>Pat's Story</h3>
              <p>When Pat was a teenager, he thought of a genius idea by combining two signature Seattle icons: Develop a recipe for a coffee-time confection called Salmon Cookies. They're cookies made into the shape of a salmon, and actually made with salmon (though the fish is ground up so fine that you can't even taste it!) that is the ideal match for a steaming cup of coffee on a gray Seattle morning. Or gray Seattle afternoon... whatever. Ever since, tourists went gaga for them, and locals begrudgingly fell in love with them.</p>

              <h3>Our Mission</h3>
              <p>At the time when Pat set up shop, he shared his vision with his team of providing clean, unprocessed food on the table for customers. Instead of following in the footstep of other sellers that farm salmon and dye them to an appealing color, the team focuses on what's more important: The ethics and taste. The team utilizes the income that would otherwise be used for food coloring to ensure that all their food is prepared in a clean environment.</p>
